The Negar Remap software is considered the only native application and platform for ECU dump remapping, with all its options and features in Persian language. One of the most important technical problems for mechanics and students in the automotive field is the lack of specialized software for ECU remapping in Persian with a user-friendly interface. On the other hand, learning the existing software is extremely time-consuming due to the high complexity of foreign examples. The terms used in foreign remapping applications are specialized, and learning these terms requires a lot of time and effort.
The Negar Remap software, with its Persian language and user-friendly interface, can meet the needs of all users at various levels, from beginners to professionals. All remapping tables in the Negar Remap software are displayed in a separated manner, allowing you to edit them with complete peace of mind. After making the desired edits and before applying the changes, there is the ability to compare between the two dump states. As a result, before uploading the dump to the ECU, you can check the harmonic status of the changes. The automatic and advanced checksum feature is one of the notable capabilities of this Persian software, which is available to users for free.

    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.

<div class="caption">
    This image can also have a caption. It's like magic.
</div>

You can also put regular text between your rows of images, even citations {% cite einstein1950meaning %}.
Say you wanted to write a bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>

The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}

```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
  <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
</div>
```

{% endraw %}
