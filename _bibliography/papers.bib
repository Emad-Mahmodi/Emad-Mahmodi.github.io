  title={A drift aware adaptive method based on minimum uncertainty for anomaly detection in social networking},
  author={Emad Mahmodi*, and  Hadi Sadoghi Yazdi*, and Abbas Ghaemi Bafghi*,},
  abstract={The social attack is an example of the anomaly that often changed their behavior, increased data volumes, and should be detected as early as possible to minimize damage. Data streaming mining is one of the solutions, which can handle the social attacks, and adapt to the change in the anomaly data stream. In this paper, we propose Online Fusion of Experts based on a minimum uncertainty to predict the concept drift in a data stream of social network-attack. Online learning algorithms such as Linear-order algorithms and Gaussian-order algorithms employ as an expert to identify the change in the anomaly data stream. First, online learning algorithms determine the error value for each data sample when data stream enter individually. Second, O F E utilizes a maximum-posterior estimation of the error rate of online learning algorithms to generate a new input data stream. Third, the Uncertainty Error Correlation},

  title={A novel trust computation method based on user ratings to improve the recommendation},
  author={R Barzegar Nozari, and  H Koohi, and E Mahmodi*,},
  abstract={Today, the trust has turned into one of the most beneficial solutions to improve recommender systems, especially in the collaborative filtering methods. However, trust statements suffer from a number of shortcomings, including the trust statements sparsity, users' inability to express explicit trust for other users in most of the existing applications. To overcome these problems, this work presents a method for computing implicit trust based on user ratings, in which four influential factors including Similarity, Confidence, Analogous Opinion, and Distance are utilized to achieve trust. For computing users’ similarity, Person Correlation Coefficient measure was applied. Confidence was computed through users’ common in rated items. To compute users’ analogous opinions, their ratings were evaluated from three aspects of their satisfaction, dissatisfaction, and indifference about the items. Euclidean distance was employed on users ratings for computing the distance. Finally, the factors were combined to reach the implicit trust. Moreover, fuzzy c-means clustering was applied to initially partition similar users for enhancing the performance positively. Finally, two MovieLens datasets of 100K and 1M have been used to evaluate this approach, and results have shown that the approach significantly increases Accuracy, Precision and Recall, compared to some other existing methods.},

  title={UDIS: Enhancing Collaborative Filtering with Fusion of Dimensionality Reduction and Semantic Similarity},
  author={H.Koohi, and  Z.Kobti, and T.Farzi, and E.Mahmodi*,},
  abstract={n the era of vast information, individuals are immersed in choices when purchasing goods and services. Recommender systems (RS) have emerged as vital tools to navigate these excess options. However, these systems encounter challenges like data sparsity, impairing their effectiveness. This paper proposes a novel approach to address this issue and enhance RS performance. By integrating user demographic data, singular value decomposition (SVD) clustering, and semantic similarity in collaborative filtering (CF), we introduce the UDIS method. This method amalgamates four prediction types—user-based CF (U), demographic-similarity-based (D), item-based CF (I), and semantic-similarity-based (S). UDIS generates separate predictions for each category and evaluates four different merging techniques—the average, max, weighted sum, and Shambour methods—to integrate these predictions. Among these, the average method proved most effective, offering a balanced approach that significantly improved precision and accuracy on the MovieLens dataset compared to alternative methods.},
